# portfolio

<!--THE PROCESS-->
When making my porfolio, I started with acquiring the images which are all from works I've one. All apart from one use in the navigation bar which will be linked below. After getting my images, I imported bootstrap and decided to choose the scrolling library "Animate on Scroll". I also had to import a font-awesome kit link to be able to import icons. Then I made sure to get the exact color scheme use in the mockups. After that, I then headed to google fonts to get the Raleway font which is the only font used in the mockup and the final site.

I started with the nav-bar, using a vertical format and including an image of myself. This area was a little challenging in the beginning as I ebate whether to use a rop-own menu to display the items tht I would display in the Work Section. However, I ultimately ended up sticking to the base single link format. Next was the home section which consists of the introduction area where you learn who I am and what I'm about.

Next up came the services and work sections, which are quite similar as they use a similar column structure. For the services area, I made use of the Font Awesome icons as well as describing the services I have to offer.
The work section uses images from my work and consists of a list of some of my recent design work as well as a brief description of what they're meant to be.

The About section came next and used a very similar format to the Services section, but it contained no icons an rather just some of my past(and present) education and work experience.

The final section with real content is the about section which contains a basic, customized form.

Then the final area of the page is the footer which contains some generic copyright information on the left and some social media links to the right.

Overall, getting the site to be responsive prove to be the most challenging part of the task, as I constantly ran into issues with different versions. Ultimtely, I'm gld I was able to match my mockups as closely as possible. I efinitely learned the importance of checking if something looks presentable on all screen sizes. Also I learned Bootstrap has a nice library of assets to utilise, such as the nav bar template which I built upon to create my nav bar.
